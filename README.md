**So Far:**

-Multi-threading for computation intensive data processing in app background. 

-Trilinear interpolations for accurate simulation from limited data sets. 

-Approximately 300,000 data points manipulated in real time at 100+ fps


**To Do List:**

-Tweak interpolation for more accurate particle 
simulation

-Add particle time control for viewing in slow motion and reverse

-Add UI elements for changing visualization states and particle features.
